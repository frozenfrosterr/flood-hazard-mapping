GIS-based flood hazard mapping project using QGIS and Python

# Flood Hazard Mapping Project 🌊

This project demonstrates the process of developing a **flood hazard map** using GIS and Python.  
It simulates NVE’s workflow of identifying flood-prone areas based on topography and hydrology.

## 🗺️ Tools Used
- QGIS
- Python (Rasterio, Geopandas, Shapely)
- Leaflet.js (for web map)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Collected DEM and river data (SRTM + OpenStreetMap)
2. Generated flow direction & accumulation maps
3. Classified flood-prone areas
4. Created an interactive web visualization
